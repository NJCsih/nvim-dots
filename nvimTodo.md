# Nvim Todo:

- [X] fix harpoon -- use C-j not <leader>j
- [ ] fix undodir. Just make it static somewhere in nvim conf. they shouldent be *that* big
- [ ] make win term slightly transparent with the nord blue, at like 95%. or just remove the invis background from colormypencils
- [X] learn to call colormypencils, I forgot how to do that
- [X] set global statusline [set laststatus=3] by default in nvimrc -- also finish that teej video for everything else in that video
- [ ] fix TS syntax highlighting for for everything, and make it work for markdown? if possible
 -- not really possible - [ ] make <C-backspace> in edit mode do "<C-o>db" maybe B not b?
- [X] set no neck pain on startup, it automatically turns off if you open aother buffer and <leader>n is easy If I dont want it.
- [ ] Is there a way to have a good session saver thing? so I can just launch into whatever session from the loading scree? also put some pixel art there saying nvim or something. Can it set the cd of the term?
- [ ] for markdown files:
        - setlocal softwrap
        - setlocal spell lang+en_us
        - wordcount in statusline
        - highlighting for ==this==
        - trim trailing whitespace on save
        - autosave on stop typing. undotree will help, but still
- [ ] show invisibles font
- [ ] good github integration for showing difference between files. and comitting changes and reading prs from nvim
- [ ] smart indent on wrap - set indent length to be bigger on md, so "- [ ] " can work, but less in others? maybe just set the indent distance to be like 6 in py, but less in others that dont need it?
- [ ] install a better term on mu
- [ ] stylus nord theme google calendar
- [ ] stylus set nord theme for canvas
- [ ] get a pack of sticky notes and little bookmark stickies.
- [X] make it stay on lock screen longer before the display turns off, flaunt the gay
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtM1mrWjUo Watchi this, take notes.
- [ ] setup latex for nvim, get a setup that can take notes very copmetently
        - vimtex
- [ ] Md to pdf via pandoc? maybe setup the same for latex?
- [ ] Make enabeling no neck pain close undodtree, and opening undotree close no neck pain
